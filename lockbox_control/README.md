# Control

The box is controlled with a python application. Install the requirements with:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The box will be automatically found over mDNS. If it cannot be found, confirm that the box is connected to the same network. If multiple boxes are connected to the network, you will need to specify which box you want to address.

for help, run:

```bash
python3 main.py -h
```
